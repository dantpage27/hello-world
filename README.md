# hello-world
This is the traditional first Repository on GitHub (or first project traditionally of any language for that matter).

This is Dan.

I like cats, porgs, and computers.  My current focus is on Python on SQL for automation and Data Analysis.  I would love to improve my Machine Learning skills and eventually venture into the wide world that is the Linux Operating System so that I can understand more about how computers really work.
